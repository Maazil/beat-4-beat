## TypeScript Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- TypeScript strict; avoid `any` unless justified.
- Follow functional programming principles where possible
- Use interfaces for data structures and type definitions
- Prefer immutable data (const, readonly)
- Use optional chaining (?.) and nullish coalescing (??) operators

## Solid Guidelines
- Use best practices from the [Solid documentation](https://docs.solidjs.com/quick-start) and/or [Tutorials](https://bejamas.com/hub/tutorials/practical-guide-to-solidjs-library)
- Use Solid parent components with children for wrappers
- Use Solid stores for state management where appropriate
- Use Solid's built-in reactivity features (signals, memos, effects)
- Use Solid's lazy loading for route-based code splitting
- Keep components small and focused

## General Coding Guidelines
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Follow consistent coding style and conventions
- Write meaningful comments and documentation
- Use version control (Git) with clear commit messages
- Write unit tests for critical functionality
- Perform code reviews for all changes
- Optimize for performance and scalability
- Handle errors and exceptions gracefully
- Ensure security best practices are followed
- Avoid hardcoding values; use configuration files or environment variables
- Keep dependencies up to date and minimize bloat but enforce trustPolicy and explicitly set minimumReleaseAge to 14 days to reduce the risk of installing compromised packages
- Use linters and formatters to enforce code quality (e.g., ESLint, Prettier)
- Regularly refactor code to improve structure and eliminate technical debt
- For best practices specific to frameworks or libraries used (e.g., Solid, Vite, TailwindCSS), refer to their official documentation and community guidelines (for pnpm https://pnpm.io/supply-chain-security)
